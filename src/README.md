# AI Alignment Project: Workflow and Runnable Example

## 1. Define the Workflow
The project guides users through the following stages:
1. **Preprocessing**: Preparing and augmenting the dataset.
2. **Training**: Fine-tuning or RLHF-based training of the LLM.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing model alignment through explainability, bias analysis, and safety tests.
4. **Deployment**: Running an API to interact with the trained model.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporating user feedback for iterative improvement.

- **Workflow**:
  1. Load the preprocessed data.
  2. Fine-tune a pretrained LLM with `fine_tuning.py`.
  3. Optionally, enhance alignment with human feedback via `rlhf.py`.
  4. Log training results using `mlflow_tracking.py`.

  - `notebooks/04_evaluation.ipynb`
- **Workflow**:
  1. Evaluate the model's responses for alignment using:
     - Safety metrics (`safety_tests.py`).
     - Explainability tools (`metrics.py`).
     - Bias analysis (`bias_analysis.py`).
  2. Display performance metrics and insights via `explainability_dashboard.py`.

### (d) Deployment
- **Files**:
  - `src/deployment/fastapi_app.py`
  - `src/deployment/endpoints/predict.py`, `feedback.py`
  - Docker/Kubernetes configs (`deployment/docker-compose.yml`, `deployment/kubernetes`)
- **Workflow**:
  1. Start the FastAPI app to serve the trained model (`fastapi_app.py`).
  2. Use endpoints:
     - `/predict`: For inference.
     - `/feedback`: To capture user feedback.
  3. Deploy in a containerized environment using Docker or Kubernetes.

### (e) Feedback Loop
- **Files**:
  - `app/feedback.py`
  - `src/reinforcement/multi_objective_rl.py`
- **Workflow**:
  1. Capture real-world feedback via `/feedback` API or UI (`app/templates/feedback.html`).
  2. Retrain the model using `multi_objective_rl.py` to incorporate feedback.

## 3. Runnable Example: A Hands-On AI Alignment Experiment

### Step 1: Data Preparation
Run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python src/preprocessing/preprocess_data.py --input data/raw/synthetic_data.csv --output data/processed
```

### Step 2: Fine-Tuning
Train the model using the preprocessed data:
```bash
python src/training/fine_tuning.py --data_dir data/processed --output_dir models/fine_tuned
```

#### Explanation:
- **Input**: 
  - The script processes data from the `data/processed` directory, which contains cleaned and tokenized datasets.
  
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: 
  - The fine-tuning script applies supervised learning to adjust the weights of a pretrained large language model (LLM).
  - Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can be customized in the script or via configuration files.
  - The fine-tuning process adapts the model to perform alignment-specific tasks (e.g., producing safe, unbiased, and interpretable outputs).

- **Output**: 
  - A fine-tuned model is saved in the `models/fine_tuned` directory. This model is now better aligned with the desired objectives and can be evaluated for safety, bias, and interpretability.

- **Integration with Experiment Tracking**:
  - If `mlflow_tracking.py` or a similar tracking tool is used, fine-tuning results (e.g., loss curves, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters) are logged for reproducibility.
  - Users can compare different runs, evaluate the impact of hyperparameter changes, and select the best-performing model.

- **Key Learnings**:
  - Fine-tuning allows a general-purpose LLM to be adapted for specific tasks, making it more relevant for real-world alignment challenges.
  - Regular evaluation during training ensures that the model maintains alignment with predefined objectives (e.g., minimizing bias or toxicity).
  - Users gain practical experience with data preparation, model training, and the iterative nature of fine-tuning.

- **Next Steps**:
  1. Evaluate the fine-tuned model using metrics, safety tests, and bias analysis (Step 3: Evaluate Alignment).
  2. Deploy the fine-tuned model as an API or in an interactive application (Step 4: Start the API).

#### Common Challenges and Solutions:
1. **Overfitting**:
   - Problem: The model may overfit on the fine-tuning dataset, losing its generalization ability.
   - Solution: 
     - Use regularization techniques such as dropout.
     - Implement early stopping during training.
     - Monitor validation loss and tune the dataset size for diversity.

2. **Insufficient Alignment**:
   - Problem: The fine-tuned model may still produce misaligned or biased outputs.
   - Solution:
     - Incorporate Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for further alignment.
     - Use safety tests and bias analysis to identify problematic outputs and retrain iteratively.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Problem: Suboptimal hyperparameter settings may lead to poor performance or inefficiency.
   - Solution:
     - Use a hyperparameter tuning framework like Optuna or implement grid/random search.
     - Explore automated scripts for hyperparameter optimization (`ppo_hyperparameter_tuning.py`).

4. **Scalability Issues**:
   - Problem: Fine-tuning large LLMs may require significant computational resources.
   - Solution:
     - Use distributed training methods (`distributed_rl.py`).
     - Leverage cloud-based GPUs or TPUs for faster training.

#### Practical Tips:
- Ensure that the dataset used for fine-tuning aligns with the project's ethical and performance goals.
- Regularly save checkpoints during training to prevent data loss and allow resuming interrupted runs.
- Log all experiments systematically for reproducibility and knowledge sharing among team members.

#### Real-World Applications:
- This step can adapt the LLM for tasks such as:
  - Generating safe conversational responses in chatbots.
  - Mitigating bias in summarization or text generation.
  - Enhancing explainability for AI models in sensitive domains like healthcare or law.

By completing this step, you now have a fine-tuned model that serves as the foundation for subsequent evaluation and deployment in your AI alignment project.
