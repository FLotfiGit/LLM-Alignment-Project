# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. What is the LLM Alignment Template?

**LLM Alignment Template** is a starting point for building large language model (LLM) alignment projects using techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), transfer learning, and data augmentation. It provides a well-structured setup for quickly developing, training, and deploying aligned LLMs.

## 2. Who should use this template?

This template is aimed at data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers who are interested in customizing large language models for specific tasks while aligning them with human values and expectations.

## 3. How do I get started with this project?

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-Alignment-Template.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies as described in the README.
3. Use the provided training scripts to start fine-tuning your LLM.

## 4. What are the key features of this template?

- **Interactive Web Interface** for LLM interaction and feedback collection.
- **Training with RLHF** for model alignment with human preferences.
- **Data Augmentation** using techniques like back-translation.
- **Transfer Learning** using pre-trained models for customization.
- **Monitoring and Explainability Dashboards** to understand and visualize model behavior.

## 5. How do I contribute to this project?

We welcome contributions! Please refer to the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get involved.

## 6. How do I report a bug or suggest an enhancement?

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-Alignment-Template/issues) on GitHub. Use the appropriate template (Bug Report or Feature Request) to provide all the necessary details.

## 7. What are the prerequisites to run this project?

- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud provider)
- Node.js (for front-end dependencies)

## 8. How is data augmentation used in this project?

Data augmentation in this project is implemented using the `data_augmentation.py` script, which employs techniques like **back-translation** and **paraphrasing** to create more diverse and effective training data, improving model performance and robustness.

## 9. Where can I find the documentation for the API?

API documentation is available in Swagger format, and you can find it in the `app/static/swagger.json` file. You can also interact with it through the web interface once the server is up and running.
