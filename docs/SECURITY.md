# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release security updates only for the most recent version of the **LLM Alignment Template**. If you are using an older version, please consider upgrading to ensure you receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we greatly appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly. Please **do not** file a public issue on GitHub, as this may put the security of our users at risk. Instead, please send a detailed report to:

**[security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible, such as:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any potential impact you have identified.
- Possible fixes or mitigation steps (if you have any suggestions).

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 5 working days. During this period, we may reach out to you for additional information.

## Preferred Languages

We accept vulnerability reports in **English**.

## Disclosure Policy

To protect our users, we request that any security vulnerability reported to us is kept confidential until we have a resolution in place and a reasonable time frame has been provided for users to upgrade.

Once a vulnerability is resolved, we will provide credit to the person who reported it (if they wish) and will publish the details in our release notes or a security advisory.

## Thank You

We appreciate the efforts of the security community in making our projects safe and secure. Thank you for your help and understanding.
