# LLM Alignment Assistant

## 🌟 Overview

**LLM Alignment Assistant** is an advanced tool designed to assist in aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired human values and objectives. This project offers a full-stack approach to training, fine-tuning, deploying, and monitoring LLMs using **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**. The system also incorporates evaluation metrics to ensure ethical and effective use of language models. The assistant provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the alignment, visualization of training metrics, and deploying the system at scale using cloud-native technologies.

- **🐋 Docker Build & Push**: Docker images are built and pushed to Docker Hub.
- **☸️ Kubernetes Deployment**: Automatically deploy to the Kubernetes cluster upon merging.

## 🤖 Training and Fine-Tuning

### 💡 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

The training module includes:
- **📊 Fine-Tuning**: Using the `training/fine_tuning.py` script, models can be fine-tuned on specific datasets.
- **🏆 Reward Models**: Implemented in `training/reward_model.py` for evaluating the appropriateness of responses.
- **🌐 Distributed Training**: Support for distributed training using `training/rlhf.py`.

### 🎛️ Hyperparameter Tuning

For hyperparameter tuning, **Optuna** has been integrated to provide automated exploration of the training parameters, ensuring optimal model performance.

## 🔄 Data Pipeline

- **🛠️ Data Augmentation**: Using advanced NLP techniques, including back-translation and embedding-based masking, available in `preprocessing/augmentation.py`.
- **✅ Validation**: Thorough validation scripts (`preprocess_data.py` and `validate_data.py`) to maintain data quality.
- **⚙️ Automation with Apache Airflow**: Data pipeline orchestration using Airflow, ensuring proper data flow between stages.

## 📈 Evaluation and Monitoring

- **📊 Metrics**: The `evaluation/metrics.py` script provides a detailed analysis of model performance, including bias detection and fairness metrics.
- **🛡️ Safety Testing**: Ethical AI assessments using `evaluation/safety_tests.py`.
- **📊 Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with **Streamlit**, displaying key metrics, including training loss, accuracy, and reward trends.

## 🌐 Web Interface Improvements

- **📈 Interactive Visualizations**: Added **Chart.js** visualizations to present alignment metrics in a clear, graphical format.
- **💬 Chatbot Integration**: A conversational UI element to interact directly with the trained LLM.

## 🧪 Testing

- **✅ Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/`, covering training, preprocessing, and evaluation.
- **🔄 Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests that simulate full pipeline execution.
- **🧪 Mock Testing**: Use of `pytest-mock` to simulate API calls and external integrations.

## 📊 Monitoring and Logging

- **📈 Monitoring**: Kubernetes monitoring using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for scalability.
- **🔍 Explainability**: SHAP and LIME explainability metrics are added to the evaluation process, providing insights into model behavior.
- **📜 Logging**: Centralized logging using **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

## 🚀 Future Work
